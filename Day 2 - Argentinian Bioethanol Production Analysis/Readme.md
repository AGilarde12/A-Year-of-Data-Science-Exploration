# Day 2 - Argentinian Bioethanol Production Analysis

On my secon day, I wanted to tackle some translation work and a time series datset.

I first started by looking for a spanish dataset and found that the Argentinian government offers some pretty cool datasets.

## Data Source
The portal for all of their around 1k datasets is here: https://datos.gob.ar/dataset

The download for the Bioethanol data is here: https://datos.agroindustria.gob.ar/dataset/produccion-bioetanol-por-insumo-utilizado

## What I learned

I learned how to translate rows and columns using my own knowledge and Google's Translate API and package
I learned how to decompose my timeseries data and spot trends
I learned how to fit a datetime index to my dataframe to allow for time series analysis
I fit/graphed decompositions & ARIMA model, but did not have time in an hour and a half to test

## What I want to do next
I had some trouble with the translate API and building the ARIMA model. I'm coming from R so it was harder for me build a good working model while also figuring out the syntax for the data cleaning. I'd like to get faster at this.
