# Day 1 - Covid-19 Data from Bing's API

To start the 365 Days of Data Challenge, I wanted to focus mostly on grouping data and exploring it on a broder level.

I first started looking at COVID-19 Data from Bing's Query Dataset. I grouped and analyzed query data by country and by date.

## Data Source
Data Source: Bing Coronavirus Query set (https://github.com/microsoft/BingCoronavirusQuerySet)

## What I learned

I learned how to query data directly from a Raw file in github
Learned how to quickly visualize and understand a dataset utilizing the head, tail and value count function
Sorted and grouped the data by Query, Country, and date to get a better idea of the dataset itself

## What I want to do next
I want to continue to learn on how to sus out strange data. Some queries while looking through the dataset looked as if they were mistakes and should not be in there
Ex. hzz
