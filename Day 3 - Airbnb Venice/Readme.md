# Airbnb Housing Data from Venice, Italy
I wanted to fit a model this time around and explore a new dataset. Some of my family live in Calabria, Italy and I love Venice. As most tourists do.

## Dataset
Data was pulled from this website - http://insideairbnb.com/

Specifically here - http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

## What I learned
I learned how write some plotting functions for data inflows using the Seaborns package

I also learned some great and interesting things about the distribution of Room types and Neighbourhood groups in Venice

At the end of the Notebook I try plot correlation plots and fit a quick regression model.

I need to find a better model to handle categorical variables as well
