# Day 6 - Used Car Sale Scrape

On my sixth day, I wanted to tackle something I didn't know much about - cars.

## Data Source
Special thanks to Austin Reese who developed a flask app to scrape used car data from Craiglist - https://github.com/AustinReese/UsedVehicleSearch

## What I learned


## What I want to do next
I had some trouble with the translate API and building the ARIMA model. I'm coming from R so it was harder for me build a good working model while also figuring out the syntax for the data cleaning. I'd like to get faster at this.
